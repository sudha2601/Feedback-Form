🛠️ Overview
This project is a fully functional and elegant Feedback Collector Web Application developed using React with Vite. It enables users to submit their name, email, and a feedback message through a clean and interactive form interface. The submitted data is instantly stored in the Firebase Realtime Database, ensuring seamless storage and retrieval.

🎨 Frontend Design
The user interface is designed using a combination of Tailwind CSS and React-Bootstrap, resulting in a modern, responsive, and visually pleasing layout. Tailwind CSS provides utility-first styling for quick and flexible UI design, while React-Bootstrap contributes with pre-styled components for consistent structure and ease of use.

🔀 Navigation
The app utilizes React Router for smooth client-side navigation between views. Users can easily switch between the feedback form and the admin section without reloading the page. This enhances the overall experience by maintaining a single-page application feel.

📦 Backend Integration
On the backend, the app is integrated with Firebase Realtime Database. When a user submits feedback, it is pushed directly to the database. The admin view fetches and displays this data in real time, providing a live view of all submissions. This approach ensures both efficiency and reliability in data handling.

🧾 Final Notes
This project demonstrates the seamless integration of a modern frontend stack with a real-time backend service to build a complete feedback collection system. It meets the task requirements, including form handling, real-time data updates, and a responsive layout. The developer’s name is also embedded in the footer as a watermark, fulfilling all submission guidelines.
